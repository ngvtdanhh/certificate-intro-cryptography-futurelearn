## 🔐 Secure Communication

| System   | Role of Cryptography |
|----------|----------------------|
| HTTPS    | Protects web traffic (TLS: encryption + certs) |
| Email    | PGP/GPG encrypt email messages |
| Messaging| Signal Protocol in WhatsApp, Signal |

## 🧠 Authentication

- Password hashing with salt (e.g., bcrypt)
- Public key authentication for SSH
- OAuth, tokens, and digital certificates (X.509)

---

## 🪪 Digital Identity

- Digital Signatures – non-repudiation & authenticity
- Code signing – prove software integrity
- SSL/TLS certificates – verify websites

## 💸 Cryptography in Blockchain

| Feature       | Crypto Component |
|---------------|------------------|
| Wallet        | Public/private key pair |
| Transactions  | Signed using private keys |
| Mining        | Hashing (SHA-256 in Bitcoin) |
| Immutability  | Hash pointers link blocks |

## 🛡️ File Protection

- Full-disk encryption (e.g., BitLocker, LUKS)
- ZIP/7z file encryption
- Encrypted cloud storage (MEGA, Tresorit)
