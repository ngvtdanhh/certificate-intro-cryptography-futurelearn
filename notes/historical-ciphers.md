# 🕰️ Historical Ciphers

Modern cryptography is built upon centuries of techniques used in warfare, diplomacy, and espionage.

## 🏛️ Classical Ciphers

| Cipher        | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Caesar Cipher | Shift letters by fixed number |
| Vigenère Cipher | Repeating keyword determines shift |
| Substitution  | Replace letters based on fixed rule |

## 🧮 Enigma Machine

- Used by Germany in WWII  
- Complex rotor-based cipher machine  
- Broken by Alan Turing and the team at Bletchley Park

---

## 🔓 Why Are They Weak?

- Patterns in plaintext remain in ciphertext  
- Easy to brute-force with modern computing  
- No key management or entropy

---

## 🧠 Lessons for Today

- Security by obscurity ≠ real security  
- Cryptanalysis is a valid attack vector  
- Strong encryption must be based on **provable mathematics**, not "clever tricks"
